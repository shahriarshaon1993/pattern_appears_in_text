## Pattern (data) Appears In Text 

The patternFind() function takes two arguments: $text and $pattern. It uses a loop to iterate through all possible substrings of $text that have the same length as $pattern. If a substring matches the pattern, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns the counter.
